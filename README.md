AWS Lambda URL Weather Microservice
=======================================

Building a great microservice with AWS Lambda doesn't have to be hard. This D-I-Y weather app demonstrates how Lambda URL can sometimes cut the work in half.

API Gateway is a powerful tool. But AWS developers often won't need that kind of advanced functionality. In many cases, you can make your job easier by taking advantage of the new Lambda URL feature in AWS. This simple weather info application demonstrates how you can (1) write a single-function microservice; then (2) hook it up using with an HTTPS endpoint.

Quick start
-----------

For simplicity, I'm not using any external dependency or module. You just need to add your [API KEY](https://openweathermap.org/api) from OpenWeather and you should be good to go.
